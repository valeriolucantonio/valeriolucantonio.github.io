{"about" : "I earned a bachelor degree at the University of L'Aquila in 4 years while working as waiter in a restaurant part time. During that period I also volunteered for a year in my small village, collaborating with some people to increase tourism activity in the area. With two other men of the village we made a project for tracking paths on the mountains near my village. After I received my degree i tried, instead, to make some money with my future job, designing websites and desktop applications. At the same time i was selected for an international program named Global Software Engineering European Master that allowed me to take two master degrees, one from the University of L’Aquila (Italy) and another from Malardalen University (Sweden). After one year studying in L’Aquila and completing all the exams I moved forward to Vasteras (Sweden) for two semesters; the first one doing exams, while in the second I did my master thesis. After completed the master degree, my aim is to find an international company where to grow my perspectives and knowledge, while allowing me also to live surrounded by the mountains." ,
