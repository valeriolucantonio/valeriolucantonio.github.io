{"about" : "I earned a bachelor degree at the University of L'Aquila in 4 years while working as waiter in a restaurant part time. During that period I also volunteered for a year in my small village, collaborating with some people to increase tourism activity in the area. With two other men of the village we made a project for tracking paths on the mountains near my village. In the meantime, I also in a real estate agency in my village, for a short period of six months. After I received my degree i tried, instead, to make some money with my future job, designing websites and desktop applications. At the same time i was selected for an international program named Global Software Engineering European Master that allowed me to take two master degrees, one from the University of LAquila (Italy) and another from Malardalen University (Sweden). Currently (09/2014) i m undergoing the second year of my masters degree. As a result, I am currently living in Vasteras (Sweden). After this experience, I hope to find a job in a company. that allows me to live surrounded by nature and mountains." ,
