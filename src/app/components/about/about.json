			"description": "I am Valerio and I am a Software Engineer from Italy. At the moment I am living in Zurich, Switzerland where working as Frontend Engineer for Evooq, a fast growing startup in the financial sector. I have been living in Switzerland for the last years, and I really love it also thanks to the sports I do: climbing, hinking and skiing. Other thing I love are eating and cooking, guess it's DNA, traveling and photography. I wish to travel all the world one day."
